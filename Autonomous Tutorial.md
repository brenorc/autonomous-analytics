# Autonomous DB Tutorial 

**First of all, download all the required material [here](http://140.238.185.3/assets/files/workshop_files.zip)**

## OCI First Steps

Oracle Cloud is available in some Regions.

Each region have 3 Availability Domains, which represents 3 different Data Centers. Each one have Fault Domains, which represents physical machines located at the Data Center.

These machines are connected via Physical Networks that makes sure our customer will have high speed / low latency services, but they do not have to manage these networks.

We offer off-box Network Virtualization, which moves
storage and network IO out of the hypervisor and enables lower overhead and bare metal instances.

Over this basic infrastructure, we provide the PaaS and IaaS necessary for our customer to reach their goals.

### Hands-on: Creating the Autonomous DB

Access https://cloud.oracle.com and login with the credentials provided by the trainer

![Cloud_login](https://i.imgur.com/c6aRDg5.png)



Select Autonomous Data Warehouse in the Upper-left menu (aka hamburger menu) 

![Cloud_login2](https://i.imgur.com/ibxQ1tO.png)

Create a new database. You will have to choose:

(For this example you can keep the default values)

- The cloud compartment where it will be located.
- The database name and its display name.
- The workload type (ATP or ADW)
- The deployment type (Serverless or Dedicated)
- The CPU count and Storage
- The password for the admin account
- The license type (BYOL or New License)

![Cloud_login3](https://i.imgur.com/nP4sAHl.png)

To make sure the database is working as intended, we are going to log into SQL Developer Web.

In the Database, go to Service Console

![OML Users](https://i.imgur.com/Hp4KKJw.png)

Select SQL Developer Web in the Development Menu

![SampleQuery](https://i.imgur.com/jZsRoF0.png)

Login with the admin user and your password, and use the following sample query:

```sql
SELECT channel_desc, TO_CHAR(SUM(amount_sold),'9,999,999,999') SALES$,
   RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(amount_sold)) AS default_rank,
   RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(amount_sold) DESC NULLS LAST) AS custom_rank
FROM sh.sales, sh.products, sh.customers, sh.times, sh.channels, sh.countries
WHERE sales.prod_id=products.prod_id AND sales.cust_id=customers.cust_id
  AND customers.country_id = countries.country_id AND sales.time_id=times.time_id
  AND sales.channel_id=channels.channel_id
  AND times.calendar_month_desc IN ('2000-09', '2000-10')
  AND country_iso_code='US'
GROUP BY channel_desc;
```

Your results should look like the picture below:

![SampleQuery2](https://i.imgur.com/tWRkQRl.png)

## Autonomous Data Tools



Autonomous Data Warehouse comes with a built-in suite of tools that can help you with many of the typical data warehouse tasks. This tool suite is complementary to various capabilities accessible via the SQL command line, which themselves are covered by other workshops. To explore how these new built-in tools can make you work smarter and faster, you will take on the role of a departmental analyst at MovieStream. As a **departmental analyst**, you have been assigned the task of reviewing the sales data from Q2 of fiscal year 2020 and making recommendations for a marketing campaign based on this analysis.



### Access Autonomous Database Tools via the ADW Console

On the Autonomous Data Warehouse console page, click the **Tools** tab, and in the **Database Actions** card, click the link to **Open Database Actions**:

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/database-tools.png)

This will take you to the Autonomous Data Warehouse Database Actions home page (shown below). This page has a card for each of the most common tasks that the data warehouse user would want to perform. The cards are grouped by theme. For example, here you see groups for Development and Data Tools. Each card has a title and description.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/database-actions.png)

If you want more information about each of the tasks related to each card, then you can access the online help by clicking the Question Mark in the title bar, as indicated in the image below:

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/question-mark.png)

This will pop out a tray containing links to the relevant topics in the Autonomous Data Warehouse documentation. To close the help tray, simply click the X.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/help.png)



### Load Data to ADW

Click the **Data Load** card on the **Database Actions** home page.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/data-load.png)

To load the files from your local computer, you need to click on the first card in each of the first two rows of cards (in row one - **LOAD DATA** and row two - **LOCAL FILE**) which will mark each box with a blue tick in the bottom right corner. To move forward to the next step in this process, simply click the blue Next button.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/load-local.png)

This is where you need to locate the four files (Movie_Sales_2020.csv, Countries.csv, Days_Months.xlsx and Devices.xlsx) that you downloaded earlier! If they are easily accessible, then you can simply **drag ALL FOUR** files at one time, and drop them onto to canvas as stated in the text on the screen.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/upload.png)

Why do you have **five** cards listed on the data loading screen? This is because your spreadsheet file **Days_Months.xlsx** contains two worksheets: one for Days and one for Months. The data loading wizard automatically parsed your spreadsheet and created a separate data loading card for each worksheet. 

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/2879071187.png)

Before you load any data, let's review what the data loading wizard has discovered about the data within your data files. Let's focus on the **Countries.csv** file. Click the **pencil icon** on the right side of the card to inspect the data loading properties:

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/inspect-countries.png)

In the bar on the left, there are links for Settings, File, Table, and an Error Log. This screenshot shows the **Settings** page. Observe that this shows the structural information and intelligent default values that data wizard has created from simply looking at the file.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/data-load-settings.png)

Click **Close** in the bottom right to return to the Data Load card and then click the **green button** in the menu panel to start the Data Load job.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/green-button.png)

The time taken to load each file depends on factors including file size and network speed. The progress of the job can be monitored from the status bar and the ring to the left of each job card. When the ring is complete, the file has uploaded successfully. 

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/loading.png)



### Identify Data Problems

Navigate to the **Data Load** main page and click the **Explore** card. You'll now see table MOVIE_SALES_2020 has been loaded into your Autonomous Data Warehouse.

Click this table and then click **Source Statistics** on the panel to the left of the screen. Statistics help you quickly understand the structure and content of the table. In this case, this data presents a nice simple way to characterize the data you've just loaded. 

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/explore-sales.png)

### 

Click on the word **DAY** in the first column. You can see that there are 14 distinct values - which looks odd. The low value is **FRIDAY** (i.e. it's all uppercase) and the high value is **Wednesday**, which is in title case. The distribution of these values is shown in the bar chart at the bottom of the form (see the image above). As you move your mouse across these bars, you can see there are two separate bars for each day: one in uppercase and the other in title case.

You can also see that you have data for twelve months. This should not be a surprise, since the data extract you loaded in the previous step was for 2020. However, for your quarterly reporting project, it's obvious that you have too many months: your mission here is to analyze data only for Q2. 

From the Autonomous Database **Tools** home page, access a SQL worksheet by clicking the **SQL** card on the **Database Actions** page. Copy and paste the following SQL statement into the Worksheet.

```plsql
create table MOVIE_SALES_2020Q2 as
select COUNTRY
, initcap(DAY) as DAY -- Use title case for days
, MONTH
, GENRE
, CUSTOMER_SEGMENT
, DEVICE
, SALES
, PURCHASES
FROM MOVIE_SALES_2020
where month in ('April','May','June'); -- only want data from Q2
exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats(user, 'MOVIE_SALES_2020Q2');
```

Select the entire text in the Worksheet and press the **green** button to run these two statements. You should see that both statements have executed successfully. Having completed this step you now have a table MOVIE_SALES_2020Q2, with data for just April, May, and June. The days have all been changed to title case. Refresh to see the new table created.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/data-transforms.png)



### Create a Business Model

Start by clicking the **Business Models** card in the ADB **Database Actions** page. The page on which you'll land has some text explaining the Business Model utility in some detail, but let's dive straight in.

Press one of the **Create Model** buttons. If **MOVIE_SALES_2020Q2** is not already identified as the **Fact Table** , select it from the pick list. (Be sure to select table **MOVIE_SALES_2020Q2**, which has just the data for April, May, June, and not table MOVIE_SALES_2020, which has data for the full year!)

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/business-model.png)

Now, press **Next** to start the Auto-Business Model utility. This will take several seconds to complete, after which you'll see a dialog such as this.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/2879071220.png)

Press **Close** and select **Data Sources** from the panel at the left of the screen. You'll see that a star schema has been identified, based on the tables that you loaded in previous steps of this lab. All columns of the Fact Table, MOVIE_SALES_2020Q2, are already shown.

Press the **three dots** to the right of table DAYS and select **Expand**. Repeat this for the other three dimension tables. You should see the star schema laid out as follows:

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/2879071210.png)

Select **Hierarchies** from the list on the left of the screen and click the three dots to the right of the row for hierarchy **CONTINENT**. Click **Edit**.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/hierarchy-continent.png)

Notice that the business model tool has detected a hierarchy of Countries within Continents, based on the structure and contents of the tables in the Autonomous Data Warehouse. 

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/continent-country.png)

This is a great head start, but a better term to use for this hierarchy would be geography. Override the default *Hierarchy Name* with **GEOGRAPHY**. Override *Caption* and *Description* with **Geography** as shown below. Then click **Save**. 

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/geography.png)

Clean up hierarchy DAYS:

- Click the three dots to the right of that hierarchy and select **Edit**. 

- Change *Hierarchy Name* to **DAY**.

- Change **Caption** **and** **Description** **to** **Day**. 

  ![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/day-hierarchy.png)

This is simply a day-of-week hierarchy, but now you'll see the value of the table that the sales analyst had set up in a previous analysis. Sorting days alphabetically is not particularly helpful. What's preferable is to sort by the day number of week. Conventions for day numbers vary across the world and the DAYS table supports both the European and the North American conventions. You'll use the North American convention for this exercise. Change the *Sort By* to **DAY_NUM_USA**. Then click **Save**. 

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/sort-day.png)

Similarly, change the MONTHS dimension as follows:

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/month.png)

Now select **Measures**, the last item on the list on the left of the screen. Notice that Auto-Business Model has identified SALES and PURCHASES as candidate Measures from the Fact Table (because these are numeric columns).

a. 	Measure SALES is a dollar amount.

b.	 Measure PURCHASES is a tally of the number of purchases made.

The default aggregation expression for the measures is SUM. Other expressions could be selected, but for the purposes of this workshop, SUM is the appropriate value to select in both cases.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/sum.png)



Press **Create** and then **Yes** in the confirmation dialog. After a few seconds, the Business Model is successfully created, and represented by a card at the bottom of the screen.

Press the three dots on the top right of the card and select **Show DDL** from the list that appears. 

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/show-ddl.png)



Experienced users of Oracle Database will note that the Business Model is implemented in the database as an Analytic View. Experienced or not, it's nice to know that you didn't have to type any of that DDL! Click **Close** to return to the Business Model screen, click the **three dots** on the Business Model's card again and this time select **Analyze** from the list that appears.

You should see a data summary similar to this.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/data-summary.png)



Then click **Layout**.

Notice that there are two tabs across the top of the Layout screen.

In the Hierarchies tab:

a. Change the layout of hierarchy *GEOGRAPHY* to **All** by selecting that value from the pick list.

b. Change the layout of hierarchy *CUSTOMER_SEGMENT* to **Column**.

c. Change the layout of hierarchy *DEVICES* to **Row**.



![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/hierarchies-tab.png)



In the Measures tab:

a. Deselect measure **SALES**.

b. Select measure **PURCHASES**.

Click **Close**.

You should see a data summary similar to this.

![ALT text is not available for this image](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/workshops/adbs-tools/using-adb-tools/images/data-summary-good.png)



Having completed this step, you now have a Business Model over table MOVIE_SALES_2020Q2. This features hierarchies, measures (including aggregation expressions), and provides a preview pane in which to view the data and do some rudimentary analysis. Press **Close** to return to the Business Model page.  


## Oracle Application Express

Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a low-code development platform that enables you to build scalable, secure enterprise apps, with world-class features, that can be deployed anywhere. APEX is included on every Autonomous Database deployment, and is enabled by a single click.

For this Hands-on Lab I am going to use a guide included in the [Workshop material](http://140.238.185.3/assets/files/workshop_files.zip) (same download available in the first paragraph of this page).

My recommendation is to do the first 2 labs on this material:

- Lab 100 - Provision your Autonomous Database (Go straight to pg 17)
- Lab 200 - Adding Spatial to an APEX Application
- The other labs if you feel like you want to dive deeper into APEX. 

Feel free to skip the introduction and begin on **Page 17 - Prepare the APEX Workspace** since the ADB instance is already created. (APEX lab -> ATP_APEX_HOL_TRIAL_V1.1_PART1_OAC.pdf) 

PS: Follow every step of the guide, using the same Workspace Name otherwise the Import App process will fail. Also, you can skip the Create an Oracle Analytics Cloud exercise (pgs 22-24).



## Loading Data to ADW

In this lab, you will be uploading files to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Object Storage, creating sample tables, loading data into them from files on the OCI Object Storage, and troubleshooting data loads with errors.

To load data from files in the cloud into your Autonomous Data Warehouse database, use the new PL/SQL DBMS_CLOUD package. The DBMS_CLOUD package supports loading data files from the following Cloud sources: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Classic, Amazon AWS S3 and Microsoft Azure Object Store.



### Navigate to Object Storage

From the Autonomous Data Warehouse console, pull out the left side menu from the top-left corner and select **Object Storage**. 

![lab1](https://i.imgur.com/1i410KQ.jpg)

To learn more about the OCI Object Storage, refer to its [documentation](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Tasks/addingbuckets.htm) .

In OCI Object Storage, a bucket is the terminology for a container of multiple files.

Click the **Create Bucket** button:

![lab3](https://i.imgur.com/n2cVKib.jpg)

Name your bucket  and click the **Create Bucket** button.

![lab4](https://i.imgur.com/NCnst5O.jpg)



### Upload Files to Your OCI Object Store Bucket

Click on your **bucket name** to open it:

![lab5](https://i.imgur.com/uE1pUd5.jpg)

Click on the **Upload Object** button:

![lab6](https://i.imgur.com/pS8WSiT.jpg)

Using the browse button or select all the files downloaded in the earlier step, click Upload and wait for the upload to complete:

![lab7](https://i.imgur.com/fSa78SX.jpg)



### Copy the URL for the Files in Your OCI Object Storage

Copy following base URL that points to the location of your files staged in the OCI Object Storage. The simplest way to get this URL is from the "Object Details" in the right hand side ellipsis menu in the Object Store.

![lab9](https://i.imgur.com/SEnOa3S.png)

![lab10](https://i.imgur.com/KwgbBk4.png)

Take a look at the URL you copied. In this example above, the **region name** is us-phoenix-1, the **tenant name** is adwctraining8, and the **bucket name** is ADWCLab.

*Note:* The URL can also be constructed as below:

```lin
https://objectstorage.<region_name>.oraclecloud.com/n/<tenant_name>/b/<bucket_name>/o
```

**Save** the base URL you copied in a note. We will use the base URL in following steps.



### Creating an Object Store Auth Token

To load data from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) Object Storage you will need an OCI user with the appropriate privileges to read data (or upload) data to the Object Store. The communication between the database and the object store relies on the Swift protocol and the OCI user Auth Token.

Go back to the **Autonomous Data Warehouse Console** in your browser. From the pull-out menu on the top left, under **Identity**, click **Users**.

![lab11](https://i.imgur.com/Eyx5o4l.jpg)

Click the **user's name** to view the details. Also, remember the username as you will need that in the next step. This username could also be an email address.

![lab12](https://i.imgur.com/FnEOJPh.jpg)

On the left side of the page, click **Auth Tokens**.

![lab13](https://i.imgur.com/OownUhz.jpg)

Click **Generate Token**.

![lab14](https://i.imgur.com/5JNOUks.jpg)

Enter a friendly **description** for the token and click **Generate Token**.

![lab15](https://i.imgur.com/nyxJJMd.jpg)

The new Auth Token is displayed. Click **Copy** to copy the Auth Token to the clipboard. You probably want to save this in a temporary notepad document for the next few minutes (you'll use it in the next step).
*Note: You can't retrieve the Auth Token again after closing the dialog box.*

![lab16](https://i.imgur.com/ZqlaVGo.jpg)



### Create a Database Credential for Your User

In order to access data in the Object Store you have to enable your database user to authenticate itself with the Object Store using your OCI object store account and Auth token. You do this by creating a private CREDENTIAL object for your user that stores this information encrypted in your Autonomous Data Warehouse. This information is only usable for your user schema.

Connected as your user in SQL Developer, copy and paste the code below to SQL Developer worksheet.

```plsql
set define off
begin
  DBMS_CLOUD.create_credential(
    credential_name => 'OBJ_STORE_CRED',
    username => '<Username>',
    password => '<Auth Token>'
  );
end;
/
set define on
```

Specify the credentials for your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service: The username will be your **OCI username** (usually your email address, not your database username) and the password is the OCI Object Store **Auth Token** you generated in the previous step. In this example, the credential object named **OBJ_STORE_CRED** is created. You reference this credential name in the following steps.

![lab17](https://i.imgur.com/RJtBHii.jpg)

Run the script.

![lab18](https://i.imgur.com/aU6fl5q.png)

Now you are ready to load data from the Object Store.

To check if your credential was correctly created, use the command below:

```sql
SELECT * FROM all_credentials;
```

This will list every credential available on your Autonomous Database, along with its OWNER, CREDENTIAL_NAME, USERNAME, WINDOWS_DOMAIN, COMMENTS and if it is ENABLED or not. 



### Creating a Table to receive the data

Next we will create a Table to where we are going to load all the data we have just uploaded to the Object Storage

```sql
DROP TABLE admin.credit_scoring_100k;
CREATE TABLE admin.credit_scoring_100k 
   (customer_id number(38,0), 
    age number(4,0),

### Loading Data Using the PL/SQL Package, DBMS_CLOUD**

It is possible to use the DBMS_CLOUD package to load the data directly form object storage to the table. This is the preferred choice for any load automation.

```plsql
begin
 dbms_cloud.copy_data(
    table_name =>'CREDIT_SCORING_100K',
    credential_name =>'<insert credential>',
    file_uri_list => '<insert URL>',
    format => json_object('ignoremissingcolumns' value 'true', 'removequotes' value 'true', 'dateformat' value 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS', 'blankasnull' value 'true', 'delimiter' value ',')
 );
end;
```

To check if all your data was uploaded, you can use the command below:

```sql
select count (*) from CREDIT_SCORING_100K
```

If your result is 100000, it means every row was correctly updated to the table.



### Troubleshooting DBMS_CLOUD data loads**

Connected as your user in SQL Developer, run the following query to look at past and current data loads.

```sql
select * from user_load_operations;
```

Notice how this table lists the past and current load operations in your schema. Any data copy and data validation operation will have backed up records in your Cloud.

Run the following query to see the load that errored out.

```sql
select * from user_load_operations where status='FAILED';
```

![OML Users2](https://i.imgur.com/00E39Nn.png)

Log in as admin user and password that you assigned when you created the instance and Create new ML user. You will receive shortly an e-mail with your credentials and the link to the Oracle Machine Learning webpage.



### Working with Zeppelin Notebook for Data Mining 

- Login into OML
- Load a notebook
- Explore Zeppelin Notebooks features



##  Working with ATP and Node.js

For this example we are going to create a website running on Node.js and connect it to an Autonomous Transaction Processing Database. All the requests performed by the website are going to be sent directly to the database.

For this practice we are going to need:

- An Autonomous Transaction Processing instance (1OCPU)
- A Virtual Cloud Network
- A Linux Compute Instance

### Setting up the Virtual Cloud Network

We are not going through the ADB instance creation all again, if you have any doubts just go back to **Hands-on: Creating the Autonomous DB** 

To create the Virtual Cloud Network, you should go to the **hamburger menu -> Networking -> Virtual Cloud Network** (we usually call them VCNs)

![img](https://i.imgur.com/AyY81E0.png)

Then, you can just choose the **Networking Quickstart** option

![img](https://i.imgur.com/4rcWGjp.png)

Choose the **VCN with Internet Connectivity** and click **Start Workflow**

A wizard will be launched, simply define a name for the VCN and configure the CIDR Block using the values on the examples (just below the boxes)

![img](https://i.imgur.com/HfH0l5Y.png)

Click **Next** and your VCN will be created, along with a Private and a Public Subnet. Since we are going to connect to our Linux instance via ssh and via internet, we are going to use the Public Subnet when we're given the choice.

Click **View Virtual Cloud Network** to check the network details.

Since we are going to use some ports on this network, we will have to enable the connection via those ports. Scroll down to **Resources -> Security Lists** and choose the **Default Security List for your VCN**

![img](https://i.imgur.com/hwr5wb3.png)

Click **Add Ingress Rules** and unlock the ports **80,1522,443,3000,8080** That's all we are going to need in this example.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/xORwPl8.png)

After clicking Add Ingress Rules, just check if you have 8 total Ingress Rules. We are now ready to create our Linux Virtual Machine.

### Setting up the Linux VM

To create the Linux VM, you will have to go to the Compute Instances console. You can find it at the **Hamburger Menu -> Compute -> Instance**

![img](https://i.imgur.com/DP52OaL.png)

Click **Create Compute Instance** and a Wizard will show up. 

- Choose the **Oracle Linux 7.7** distribution under the Oracle Image tab 
- Set the Intance Shape to **VM.Standard.E2.1**
- Make sure that you are using your **VCN**, and do not forget to choose the **Public Subnet** and to **Assign a Public IP address** to your Linux Instance
- Upload a ssh .pub file to use for connecting with your VM

After sending the request to create your VM, it should take some minutes to get it running (usually no more than 3 min). You will be able to find the **Public IP Address** on the **Instance Details**

![img](https://i.imgur.com/69wTPey.png)

We will use this Public IP Address to ssh into the OS and host our website. The code is ready and available to be cloned from our Github repository.

So you are going to need tools to ssh into the instance and transfer files via FTP. I am going to use [MobaXTerm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/), but feel free to use other alternatives like Putty and WinSCP, for example.

Log into your instance by using:

- Your Public IP Address
- The opc username
- Port 22
- Your .ppk key file

![img](https://i.imgur.com/r3dJLHZ.png)

After connecting to the VM, let's change to the root user and update the OS:

```bash
sudo su
yum update -y
```

This step may take a couple minutes to finish.

Install git, which we are going to use to clone the website code:

```bash
yum install -y git
```

Create a directory and browse to it, then clone the git project with all the code needed:

```bash
mkdir /home/dev
cd /home/dev
git clone https://github.com/gustavogaspar/workshops.git
```

Alter the instancePrep.sh permissions so you can run this script. This will prepare all the environment for us.

```bash
chmod 775 workshops/instancePrep.sh
source workshops/instancePrep.sh
```

Browse to the /workshop/lib directory and install the Oracle Database Instant Client 19.x by running:

```bash
cd workshops/lib
yum -y install oracle-instantclient19.3-basic-19.3.0.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

Now we are going to connect our VM to the Autonomous DB services

### Connecting to the ADB

Every time we connect to the Autonomous Database we need to use the Wallet file. This is a file containing the credentials needed to create a connection to the ADB.

Open your **Autonomous Transaction Processing** and click **Database Connection**. This will open a window where you are able to download the credentials. Save them as a .zip file.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/BraZog5.png)



Connect via FTP to your environment and **copy the whole .zip file**

![img](https://i.imgur.com/WxczE1I.png)

Copy your wallet file to the Instant Client folder and unzip the files. Don't forget to put your wallet name in the code

```bash
cp /home/opc/<WalletName> /usr/lib/oracle/19.3/client64/lib/network/admin/

cd /usr/lib/oracle/19.3/client64/lib/network/admin/
unzip <WalletName> 
```

Start the Instant Client services by running:

```bash
sh -c "echo /usr/lib/oracle/19.3/client64/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient.conf"
ldconfig
```

Return to the directory created in the Instance configuration and install the npm packages:

```bash
cd /home/dev/workshops/backend
npm install
```

Edit the db.connect.js file according to your database configuration:

```bash
vim src/dbconnect.js
```

After opening the file, click **i** to enter the insert mode. Update your **database password** and **connectionString** (we will use your DatabaseName_TP). After editing the file, hit **ESC** and then **:wq ENTER** to save your updates and quit. We are now able to start the server:

```bash
npm start & 
```

Press **ENTER** to go back to terminal without ending the process.

To verify if your service is running you may use the command:

```bash
ps -a
```



### Frontend configuration

The backend is all configured, so all we need is to edit the frontend and our application will be ready to run.

Browse to the dev directory and edit the app.js file:

```bash
cd /home/dev
vim /home/dev/workshops/frontend/app.js
```

You will have to input you Public IP Address, so identify the string, use **i** to enter insert mode and when finished use **ESC :wq ENTER**

Finally we are going to remove the content from nginx html folder and copy our frontpage into it:

```bash
rm -rf /var/www/html/*
cp /home/dev/workshops/frontend/* /var/www/html/
```

The next step is to open your browser and type the Public IP address of your VM. If everything is correct, you will see the page below:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/lGQQVKx.png)



Basically you're given 3 options:

- Test your connection to the Database (mostly for troubleshooting)

- By using Simple Oracle Document Access (SODA), creates a table named CARROS and inserts a BLOB into the database includiung a JSON payload.
- Creates the table SERIES and inserts a simple record into the databse via SQL.

Click each one of the buttons and see if your result is a positive status. Those commands will create 2 tables in the database and insert some information into the tables. It's interesting to connect to the database via SQL Developer Web after doing the inserts to query the database and check which kind of information we have just loaded into the database.

If the data was added correctly, this is the end of our Tutorial. 



## Using the Autonomous JSON Database

*Based on: https://blogs.oracle.com/jsondb/autonomous-json-database*

It is also possible to work with JSON objects using any Oracle Autonomous Database, but the Autonomous JSON Database is optimized to do so. In this quick practice we are going to use SODA (Simple Oracle Document Access) - a native, open-source document store API for common programming languages including Java, JavaScript and Python. Developing applications with JSON and SODA is as easy with Oracle as it is with NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

First of all, **create an Autonomous Database**. I suggest creating an Autonomous JSON Database but this practice will work on the other ADB versions as well.

After logging in to **SQL Developer Web**, you can type in 'soda help' to get an overview of the soda commands:

```
soda help
```

Type the following to create a collection 'movies' and insert two JSON documents, with information related to 2 of my personal favorites

```json
soda create movies;
soda insert movies {"name":"Matrix", "launch_year":"1999","genre":["Science Fiction","Action"]}
soda insert movies {"name":"Forrest Gump", "launch_year":"1994","genre":["Comedy","Drama"]}
```

We can now query the collection to find documents matching a search/filter criteria.For example, I will look for movies with the gender set as 'Comedy'

```json
soda get movies -f {"genre":"Comedy"}  
```

![image-20201116170516521](https://i.postimg.cc/t4msDn4g/image-20201116170516521.png)

It is also possible to filter using other expressions as 'greater than', The example below queries for any movies released after 1996 (launch year greater than 1996):

```json
soda get movies -f {"launch_year":{"$gt":1996}}
```

![image-20201116171457354](https://i.postimg.cc/VNrdhsJW/image-20201116171457354.png)

In these examples we used a console to enter SODA commands. Typically, you would use SODA directly from a programming language. We do have SODA drivers for Java, JavaScript (nodeJS), Python, REST, Pl/Sql and ODPI-C.

With the JSON data stored in an Oracle Database it is also possible to use SQL to access the very same data. First, let's describe the collection:

```json
describe movies;
```

![image-20201116171558014](https://i.postimg.cc/5th6Wcvd/image-20201116171558014.png)

As one can see the JSON collection is backed by a regular table. The JSON data is stored in a binary representation optimized for fast reads and piece-wise updates. In order to convert it to a JSON string we use JSON_SERIALIZE.

```sql
select JSON_Serialize(JSON_Document) from movies;
```

![image-20201116171723295](https://i.postimg.cc/9MyzWxt4/image-20201116171723295.png)

With JSON_Table it is possible to unnest the JSON data and project it to relational columns and rows. Please note that the two JSON documents generate 4 rows as both movie have two genres each.

```sql
select j.* from movies NESTED json_document 
            COLUMNS (name, launch_year number, 
              NESTED genre[*] 
              COLUMNS(genre PATH '$')) j;
              
```

![image-20201116171857204](https://i.postimg.cc/cCmH3rz0/image-20201116171857204.png)

Going from a relational representation back to JSON is similarly easy. All we do is add one (or more) JSON generation functions to a query. In the following we are generating an array of all movies names. 

```sql
select JSON_ArrayAgg(c.json_document.name) from movies c;
```

![image-20201116172058361](https://i.postimg.cc/WzjztMX5/image-20201116172058361.png)

Autonomous JSON Database is part of the [Oracle Autonomous Database](https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/) family. Autonomous JSON Database shares all of the core features for automation, lifecycle management, security, availability, scalability and elasticity with all other Autonomous Database services and is now extending all of the autonomous benefits to JSON application developers.
